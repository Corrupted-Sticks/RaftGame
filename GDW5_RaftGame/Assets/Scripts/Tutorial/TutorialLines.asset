  - "Arr\u2019 Matey! Pirate life hasn\u2019t been going so well, huh? Guess it\u2019s
    time to tighten those boot straps and find some work in the delivery industry!
    First, let\u2019s learn the basics. Use WASD (keyboard) or left joystick (controller)
    to move around!\r\n"
  - Nice! Now Press E (keyboard) or right trigger (controller) to grab onto the mast.
    Move around and see what happens.
  - This is how you steer the ship in the direction you want. Sailing basics down!
    Maneuver your ship to a dock and release the mast with E. press F (keyboard)
    or X (controller) to dock your ship.
  - On docks you can access the Dock Menu where you can select a job, complete a
    job, and buy cool stuff! Try walking to the end of the dock to access the Job
    Menu.
  - "Go ahead and choose a job you\u2019d like to do. You can only take on one job
    at once and as soon as you accept it, the timer starts! Press the X button at
    the top right of the menu to exit."
  - You can see all the cargo you need to deliver on the dock in front of you! One
    player should head back onto the ship by pressing F (keyboard) or A (controller)
    while looking at the ship.
  - To get the cargo on the ship, the player on the dock needs to pass the cargo
    to a player on the ship. Use E  (keyboard) or right trigger (controller) to grab
    and pick up the cargo. Put it all onto the ship and make sure not to drop any
    in the water!
  - 'Cargo secured! Head back onto the ship by pressing F (keyboard) or A (controller)
    while next to the ship. '
  - "Time to set sail! You\u2019ll need a compass and a map to help you navigate.
    The red arrow around the mast points towards your destination.  Hold TAB (keyboard)
    or Y (controller) to access the map"
  - Dock your ship at the cargo destination!
  - Have one player pass all the cargo to the other player on the dock.
  - Now that all the cargo is on the dock, access the Dock Menu and register your
    job as being complete!
  - "Congrats! You\u2019ve completed your first job!"
